Still has drum brakes, original steering wheel, dual exhaust, no power steering, holley carb. Daily driver........Not a trailer queen but wouldn't take a lot to be show quality.

                "	7	"I have a very nice and well kept Mustang GT up for sale/trade. The car is a five speed and only has 126k miles on it. It has been garage kept since new. The car is very strong, and shifts through all the gears like it should. The car is not perfect with a few imperfections, but for being a 21 year old car it is in excellent condition. I purchased the car completely stock from an elderly man almost four years ago. I have put less than 10k miles on it since I've had it and only minor performance upgrades. This is not my daily driver and it is only driven every now and then on the weekends. The car comes with two different exhaust setups, one being a Flowmaster American Thunder (current setup) and the other is a SLP Loudmouth. It also has a X-pipe with no cats and it has been tuned. See pics for other mods that have been done.

                "	14	Selling my BMW 335i hard top convertible with only 47,xxx original miles and zero issues. It is a two owner vehicle with a clean carfax and always serviced at BMW dealership. It is fully loaded and has every option available including soft close doors, comfort access, navigation, iDrive, adaptive headlights, HID lamps, paddle shifters, steering wheel controls, black leather, power seats, sport package, and premium package. I have documented paperwork on every single service done on the car since it was brand new. It has extensive paperwork and services done and has had over $6000 spent in maintenance and services in the past year or so. I am 68 years old and rarely drive her much except to Sunday church and warm summer Saturdays. The paint looks like new as does the interior and it is a very fast sports car. It is completely stock and has new tires on all four corners. I have title in hand and will not negotiate over the phone. This is the lowest mile 335i I've seen out there and for the money you can't beat it. The original price of this 335i was over $60,000 new so this is merely a fraction of the price for a practically brand new car.    	2008		 like new	 6 cylinders	 rwd	 gas	 47000	 red		 clean	 automatic
